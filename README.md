Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing - E-news Project Using Hypothesis Test and statistical analysis for an E-news project. The objective is to determine if the new E-news landing page is having a better impact on acquiring new customers compared to the old landing page.


In order to answer this question, the Data Science team has selected 100 users and divided them equally into 2 groups-- new landing page and existing landing page. Existing landing page serves as the control group and the new landing page the treatment group.  Also included recommendations and observations on results found.  A significance level of 5% is used to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in acquiring new users/subscribers for the news portal. I have also been asked to answer the following questions:

​

1. Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?

2. Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?

3. Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?

4. Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?

​

I chose to approach this project the full code method--write code from scratch and then provide actions and insights at the end.
Other option was low code The low-code way is to use an existing solution notebook template to build the solution and then submit a business presentation with insights and recommendations.
